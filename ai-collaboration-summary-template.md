**Assignment:** Week 3 - Fortunate Cow

---

## Key interaction

Document one meaningful interaction where you learned something or had to adjust your approach.

**My prompt:**

> I want to use a "White Mustang" theme with a mustang creature 

**What happened:**

The Agent explained that cowsay doesn’t have a “mustang” creature file and suggested using a built-in creature like “dragon” instead. I learned that Node.js libraries may not support some creatures, and it’s better to check available files.

## Context engineering

**What effect did you observe from changing the instruction(s) to `copilot-instructions.md?**

When I added instructions to “Always use arrow functions” and “Add a comment above each variable,” Copilot began generating code that used arrow functions and included descriptive comments. This made the code more readable.

## Reflection

Answer these questions thoughtfully. A few sentences each is fine.

**What stretched you?**

I really wanted my creature to be a mustang but libraries didn't support that. Adding the mood-based eyes feature pushed me outside my comfort zone because I had to understand how to randomly select values from an array.

**What did you learn?**

For last weeks assignment I wasn't able to access Agent but I somehow got it to work for this assignment and it couldn't have been easier. I learned how to work with Node.js modules, import packages with ES modules, and debug common errors like missing cowsay files.

## Optional

**What do you want to explore further?**

I want to explore using more advanced cowsay features. 

**Approximate time spent:**

3 hours ; I ran into a lot of errors!
